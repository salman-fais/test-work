The 1D+t heat equation (again!)*\n","\n","In the lecture, we have introduced Euler's method to solve the heat equation, for which we presented a Python implementation. However, the function we designed was tailored to deal with Dirichlet boundary conditions (BCs) only. Here, we will write (and test) a function that is more adaptable to other BCs.\n","\n","***1.1.*** Consider the Python function shown below. Explain how it works. Write a separate function ```BC_D(u,k)``` implementing Dirichlet BCs and test them in the example from the lecture.

Melting an image\n","\n","As we have seen in the 2D+t example in the lecture, the temperature equation with null Dirichlet BCs smooths the image boundaries, making it blurrier as time moves on. This idea can be employed to smooth an image and eliminate (or at least minimise) smaller unwanted details just by using it as an initial condition.\n","\n","<br />\n","\n","***2.1.*** Choose an arbitrary image and verify that this is the case by means of Euler's method. ``[Python]``\n","<br />\n","\n","***Hint***: you need first to load the image and convert to greyscale using the functions seen in Lecture 1.\n","<br />\n","\n","_Note:_ this method is called _isotropic_ or Gaussian smoothing in image processing, since it smooths the image in every direction. As you will see, this does not preserve boundaries, which is a problem. For this reasons, researchers have presented anisotropic image filters, first introduced by Perona and Malik (e.g., see [this link](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/pdectb/perona2.pdf)).\n","\n","<br />\n","\n","***2.2.*** Now, we want to repeat the exercise but using RK4.

Cranky!\n","\n","One question you may have surely got from the lecture is: _how to make an algorithm with a higher order in time and space?_ A great solution to this problem was proposed by British scientists John Crank and Phyllis Nicolson, which became known as the Crank-Nicolson method. Here, we will explore its added value and, as usual, complexity. For simplicity, we will work with the 1D+t PDE\n","\n","\\begin{equation}\n","\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}=c \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}.\n","\\end{equation}\n","\n","\n","***3.1.*** The basis of the method is to employ centred, second order numerical differentials for both time and space discretisations in a smart way. ``[Hand]``\n","\n","&nbsp; &nbsp; A.
